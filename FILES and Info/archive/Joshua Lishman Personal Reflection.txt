Personal Reflection: Joshua Lisman

As more time has passed, I feel like the positives from the previous reflection been made greater, with our group communicating well and really putting in the effort needed to get this project done. I believe the strongest point of our group is our ability to talk amongst ourselves to delegate tasks, help each other and give support when needed. If we were to do this project again, I believe we could improve our groups outcome by possibly having meetings in which we are all working on the assignment at once for effectively immediate team feedback and a quicker completion time. What surprised me was again just how much we did achieve by the end of the 10 weeks working together almost day in day out which has resulted in a group of strangers becoming a great team and ever better mates.  This correlates what I learnt about groups and how its more than just a ‘workplace’ as such but a positive and friendly environment. Having used GitHub a great deal more with this assignment I believe this activity shows a balanced workload between I and the other group members as each input is tracked.

While I had my own issues with attending the group meetings and assisting with assignment tasks at the start of the new year, I heavily believe that I was the weakest link, but the group worked wonderfully together on their tasks and communication with meetings going for nearly an hour every Thursday and Sunday in some cases. They’ve been times where we’ve come together to make serious decisions instead of leaving it to the captain of the group. To me the mateship and support of this group is incredible and being apart of this has given me hope in working with others again after bad experiences. We had tackled tasks and issues in different ways that didn’t clash badly. It’s something I’ll take away from this short time together, to be more mindful to how others operate to tackle a task together. ColourTech has been fruitful and a pleasure to work with, and there isn’t too much to criticize. Besides the issue with the unresponsive teammate, I would say that a timetable or schedule that all can access and monitor what work has been done and by who, then again I could just be talking to myself but I’d believe this this would increase productiveness and help keep track of what has been completed.

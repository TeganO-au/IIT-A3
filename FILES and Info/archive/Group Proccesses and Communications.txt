Group Processes and Communication

Our group primarily uses Microsoft Teams for all communication which includes meetings that occur every Thursday and Sunday at 8pm AEDST, any small or large updates, issues etc. We also use discord as a backup in case MS Teams is down or a teammate is not responding. For any formal communication, generally the whole team and teacher are notified, is done via Microsoft Outlook email. There have been a few times where the team has been involved in an email to the teacher regarding a teammate not responding and regarding assignments where a teammate cannot participate fully due to personal reasons/safety concerns due to natural disasters. Sadly, weâ€™ve had to conclude to remove a teammate from our due to lack of any communication despite numerous attempts to reach him via MS Teams, Discord and email with the whole team and Teacher included to give an ultimatum, respond or be removed from the team and be put down as 0% contribution.

    Aims
      Aim
        Develop a device which limits the speed of a vehicle based on transmissions and/or geolocation
      Goals
        1.	Produce devices that can transmit and receive a speed limit value for a location/area
          a.	Develop transmitter
          b.	Develop receiving device
        2.	Develop area speed limits (access accurate maps with speed limits??)
          a.	Within city limits
          b.	Outside city limits
          c.	School zones
          d.	Residential areas

    Scope and limits
      What we like to achieve with the CASD system by the end of this project is that the system is practically by showing data that we can show that the CASD system can slow down the vehicle and even stop it. Number two is the features and functions that we aim to set out to are on point and achievable through the research that our colorTech team has set. Like all projects, the CASD system has certain elements of what we can achieve and their limits of what we can do with the project and this can be broken down into categories these are.
      •	Timeline -  of project is from what we can show in twelve weeks is limited to the research we have done and also what we can show data, it will take time to build the right team together with the knowledge to build and design a CASD system in an automobile.

      •	Budget – is a major issue with the project will have to show the concept works and fund this ourselves  then create and design a prospectus to show investors to raise capital to launch the product.

      •	Research
      1.	Patterns that we need around the world.
      2.	Laws into Automobiles with this system and how they be view when taking product work wide.
      3.	Manufacturing how we going to produce and supply our product to the world and the warehouse space and employees that we need.
      4.	Installation service  will provide or manufactures of cars will install, also after-hours service and warranty and claims

      •	Knowledge – Our colorTech team only has a limited know-how so to speak in regards to moving from a concept project idea to a full-scale working model of the CASD system.

      •	Planning  –  due to the actual scale of our project from concept to working model we have to ensure that we look at one piece of the puzzle at a time and ensure we have the right people in place.

      •	Obstacles – these are always going to be in our way but how we deal with them and the way we work as a team will ensure we find a way to work through to achieve our goals.

      •	Technology  -  we have to be careful by the time we build the CASD system that we haven’t missed the boat and that it’s too late and  there are newer  technologies out there that do the job better or that the manufacture produce the system them self’s.

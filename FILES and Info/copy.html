    Kevin
      My name is Kevin Brown, I am 49 years old and my student ID s3831353. I am a qualified baker by trade however I developed an allergy to flour later in life. I started managing small retail chains and developing my career in management. I have three beautiful kids, and when my son was born, I had to take a break from my career and look after him as he used to wake 30 times a night. Finally, when he was one and a half years old, I was able to land a job as a casual orderly, and I have worked my way up to a senior orderly. As a senior orderly I meet a lot of people at the worst time of their lives and some of the best time of their lives, and it makes you look at your life in a whole new light.  From a young age I have been interested in computers and have built a few of my own and helped out family and friends, I am a pc gamer and my first computer was a IBM and ever since then being interested in learning to program but never had the courage to pursue a career in IT till now.

Project Plan
  Overview
    Topic
      The purpose of the computer acceleration safety device (CASD) is to aid the driver to stay within the speed limits of the roads they are traveling anywhere in the world and not be able to accelerate more than 10 km over the limit. It will also assist drivers buy when there are accidents and emergency vehicles in the area, major works or change of conditions the CASD device will notify the car that speed limit has changed due to these circumstances and change its speed accordingly.
      Potential outcomes for the population is a decrease in the number of deaths on our roads due to high-speed crashes which will mean decreased costs such as accident costs, decrease insurance costs, maintenance on roads and vehicle costs. Not to mention the reduced costs to society itself by services will no longer be stretch in relation to ambulance, police, hospital staff and clean up crews and maintenance crews the lists go on,  the government then can then use these services were there actually needed.

    Motivation
      So as IT  student we are told to find real-world problems and solve them so here's a little history on the problem we see, in 1901 when speed limits were introduced to Australia and was designed to increase safety on our roads and reduce crashes than the speed camera was introduced in 1961 with a radar device inside to catch people speeding(Davis, 2020) as you can see from table below in the last 24 months 2,431 people have being in crashes relating to speeding, and in 2019 there were 4.7% more deaths on Australia roads than the same period as 2018(Roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au, 2020). Our CASD  is going to save lives this should be motivation enough but the second is to reduce the number of crashes on our roads and third of all is that this project will make a difference in people's lives and that why we go into IT in the first place.

      Seroius injuries crash data - June 2019 quarter
                                      12 months ending  12 months ending
                                      Jun 2019p	        Jun 2018	       # Change	% Change
      Behavior Factors
      Alcohol involved in crash 'Yes'	335	              362	             -27	    -7%
      Speeding involved in crash 'Yes	1179	            1252	           -73	    -6%
      Fatigue involved in crash 'Yes'	629	              644	             -15	    -2%

      Why is this project important or interesting?
      Overall the CASD s will be controversial because it will change laws for car owners and their rights and responsibilities regarding driving their cars. This system will also reduce the resources needed by the government to regulate car safety to speed limits. I know firsthand from working in a hospital as an orderly than the devastation that high-speed crashes not only from the victims but the family them self’s not only physically but mentally.

       How does it fit in with current IT trends?
      Then the CASD system is on-trend as the increase of technology for cars is increasing with more airbags being introduced into vehicles for safety,  along with lane assist sensors that help guide the car back into the lane,  sensors in front of the car to ensure that your car doesn’t get to close to vehicle in front and will hit the brakes if it detects obstacles in its path even cruise control being the norm in cars today and this is all about driver and passenger safety and that’s what our device is designed for everyone safety.

      What would it show to a future employer if you were able to work on this project? At least one paragraph is expected.
      Over the course of the next couple of years, our team would like to have learned and gain the knowledge and experience to have least created and designed a working scale model of our device along with the skills and team behind us to make it become a  reality. This will demonstrate that our team has a vision and a passion for what we do. The employer will see this and so much more as teamwork is such a big part of the career path we have chosen and that we had a vision and no matter what our differences were we produced the CASD that works and has changed people lives and that what all IT professional want to do.

    Landscape
      There are speed limiters out there that reduce the car overall speed of the motor vehicle example of this are Australia trucks are limited to 100kms an hour, these are call governors there are different types our there such  Mechanical, Pneumatic and Hydraulic governors (The Engineers Post, 2020). Also, there Electronic Speed Governor which is micro-control base (I diagnosis.in, 2020) but these governors don’t take into consideration the variety of speed limits changes and does reduce the car overall speed to no more than 10kms over the speed limit.  Self-driver cars use radar, sensors, GPS, sonar and lidar to take in their surroundings to ensure they keep in the guidelines of the road rules (Jameco.com, 2020).
      Market in this field is companies such as Tesla, wymo, gm cruise, argo Ai, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, Continental Automotive Systems, Autoliv Inc., Bosch, Nissan, Toyota, Audi, Volvo, Vislab from University of Parma, Oxford University and Google. But what these companies all have in common that their concentration on driverless cars. Our system is for the everyday driver that doesn’t what a completely drives car. The CASD system will always still let the driver be in control of the vehicle up to ten km over the speed limit, the default setting wherein case the GPS and sensor go down for any reason the car can still can be driven. Added features of sensors that a read any vehicle such as an emergency one, witches hats, work road signs on the road to random changes of conditions where the sensors on these can be changed to reduce speeds in this area and our system will limit speed accordingly.

    Scope and limits
      What we like to achieve with the CASD system by the end of this project is that the system is practically by showing data that we can show that the CASD system can slow down the vehicle and even stop it. Number two is the features and functions that we aim to set out to are on point and achievable through the research that our colorTech team has set. Like all projects, the CASD system has certain elements of what we can achieve and their limits of what we can do with the project and this can be broken down into categories these are.
      •	Timeline -  of project is from what we can show in twelve weeks is limited to the research we have done and also what we can show data, it will take time to build the right team together with the knowledge to build and design a CASD system in an automobile.

      •	Budget – is a major issue with the project will have to show the concept works and fund this ourselves  then create and design a prospectus to show investors to raise capital to launch the product.

      •	Research
      1.	Patterns that we need around the world.
      2.	Laws into Automobiles with this system and how they be view when taking product work wide.
      3.	Manufacturing how we going to produce and supply our product to the world and the warehouse space and employees that we need.
      4.	Installation service  will provide or manufactures of cars will install, also after-hours service and warranty and claims

      •	Knowledge – Our colorTech team only has a limited know-how so to speak in regards to moving from a concept project idea to a full-scale working model of the CASD system.

      •	Planning  –  due to the actual scale of our project from concept to working model we have to ensure that we look at one piece of the puzzle at a time and ensure we have the right people in place.

      •	Obstacles – these are always going to be in our way but how we deal with them and the way we work as a team will ensure we find a way to work through to achieve our goals.

      •	Technology  -  we have to be careful by the time we build the CASD system that we haven’t missed the boat and that it’s too late and  there are newer  technologies out there that do the job better or that the manufacture produce the system them self’s.

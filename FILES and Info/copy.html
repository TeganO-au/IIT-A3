    Joshua
      My name is Joshua Lishman, I am 21 years old and my student number is s3829198. I am half British, on my father’s side and half Australian, on my mother’s side. My highest level of completed education is the completion of year 12 but I also have completed a Certificate 3 in Information Technology and 1 and a half years of a Bachelor of Business before moving into my current study of IT. I can speak some Indonesian from multiple years of study through primary and into high school. I played rugby league for many years, from under 7s all the way to under 15s where I had my leg broken in a tackle and couldn’t play again, but I still follow it closely when I can and still to this day wish I could get back out on that field for another game.

    Kevin
      My name is Kevin Brown, I am 49 years old and my student ID s3831353. I am a qualified baker by trade however I developed an allergy to flour later in life. I started managing small retail chains and developing my career in management. I have three beautiful kids, and when my son was born, I had to take a break from my career and look after him as he used to wake 30 times a night. Finally, when he was one and a half years old, I was able to land a job as a casual orderly, and I have worked my way up to a senior orderly. As a senior orderly I meet a lot of people at the worst time of their lives and some of the best time of their lives, and it makes you look at your life in a whole new light.  From a young age I have been interested in computers and have built a few of my own and helped out family and friends, I am a pc gamer and my first computer was a IBM and ever since then being interested in learning to program but never had the courage to pursue a career in IT till now.

    Lynette
      S3728067
      I have a background in accounting, finance and retail management, but have always been the one to fix any IT problems at work and for friends. I did a small amount of IT studies 20 years ago and have since studied in the accounting/finance area but after doing half a Bachelor of Accounting have decided that my interest in IT is where my future lies so I am in the progress of changing degrees. Some of my hobbies include Netball, Basketball, Hiking and gaming on the Xbox, having hobbies my children are also involved in makes it easier to spend time together.

          a.	Develop transmitter
          b.	Develop receiving device
        2.	Develop area speed limits (access accurate maps with speed limits??)
          a.	Within city limits
          b.	Outside city limits
          c.	School zones
          d.	Residential areas

    Scope and limits
      What we like to achieve with the CASD system by the end of this project is that the system is practically by showing data that we can show that the CASD system can slow down the vehicle and even stop it. Number two is the features and functions that we aim to set out to are on point and achievable through the research that our colorTech team has set. Like all projects, the CASD system has certain elements of what we can achieve and their limits of what we can do with the project and this can be broken down into categories these are.
      •	Timeline -  of project is from what we can show in twelve weeks is limited to the research we have done and also what we can show data, it will take time to build the right team together with the knowledge to build and design a CASD system in an automobile.

      •	Budget – is a major issue with the project will have to show the concept works and fund this ourselves  then create and design a prospectus to show investors to raise capital to launch the product.

      •	Research
      1.	Patterns that we need around the world.
      2.	Laws into Automobiles with this system and how they be view when taking product work wide.
      3.	Manufacturing how we going to produce and supply our product to the world and the warehouse space and employees that we need.
      4.	Installation service  will provide or manufactures of cars will install, also after-hours service and warranty and claims

      •	Knowledge – Our colorTech team only has a limited know-how so to speak in regards to moving from a concept project idea to a full-scale working model of the CASD system.

      •	Planning  –  due to the actual scale of our project from concept to working model we have to ensure that we look at one piece of the puzzle at a time and ensure we have the right people in place.

      •	Obstacles – these are always going to be in our way but how we deal with them and the way we work as a team will ensure we find a way to work through to achieve our goals.

      •	Technology  -  we have to be careful by the time we build the CASD system that we haven’t missed the boat and that it’s too late and  there are newer  technologies out there that do the job better or that the manufacture produce the system them self’s.

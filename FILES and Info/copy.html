      My name is Joshua Lishman, I am 21 years old and my student number is s3829198. I am half British, on my father’s side and half Australian, on my mother’s side. My highest level of completed education is the completion of year 12 but I also have completed a Certificate 3 in Information Technology and 1 and a half years of a Bachelor of Business before moving into my current study of IT. I can speak some Indonesian from multiple years of study through primary and into high school. I played rugby league for many years, from under 7s all the way to under 15s where I had my leg broken in a tackle and couldn’t play again, but I still follow it closely when I can and still to this day wish I could get back out on that field for another game.

    Kevin
      My name is Kevin Brown, I am 49 years old and my student ID s3831353. I am a qualified baker by trade however I developed an allergy to flour later in life. I started managing small retail chains and developing my career in management. I have three beautiful kids, and when my son was born, I had to take a break from my career and look after him as he used to wake 30 times a night. Finally, when he was one and a half years old, I was able to land a job as a casual orderly, and I have worked my way up to a senior orderly. As a senior orderly I meet a lot of people at the worst time of their lives and some of the best time of their lives, and it makes you look at your life in a whole new light.  From a young age I have been interested in computers and have built a few of my own and helped out family and friends, I am a pc gamer and my first computer was a IBM and ever since then being interested in learning to program but never had the courage to pursue a career in IT till now.

    William
      William has not made any contact with the team sincebefore the submission of our previous assessment, so we have woked withoput his input this time.

  Group Processes
  While our group is largely introverted with vastly different personalities, the team worked very well together. We separated the assignment into individual tasks as equally as possible. While each of the task were done excellently and on time, there was an issue with the natural disaster occurring during the assignment which caused a small delay with a task being submitted that ultimately lost marks as we only had time to ask the questions that was in the assignment instead of being able to add our own to the mix. Overall, the team was very happy with the results as we were able to walk away with a High Distinction, even with the issues that occurred partway through. We will take this confidence in stride through to the next assignments to come.

  In relation to the technology, the program needs to be written in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and in this case the current version of Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, being v16.4.3, would be most optimal for its added support and flexibility. As a fallback, the 2017 iteration of Visual Studio, v15.9.19 will do but isn’t the most optimised IDE for the job.
  The reason this program will be suitable for what is needed for this project is due to the fact a vehicles’ ECU (Engine  Control Unit), is predominantly programmed in the C language specifically using MISRA C, guidelines named for the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association who have developed them to prevent "bad" code and to facilitate compatibility, performance and reliability in safety-critical systems (https://www.embedded.com/introduction-to-misra-c/).

  which Visual Studio is a recommended IDE for programming applications in the C language. Visual Studio will not need any prior experience by group members for optimal usage, as Microsoft provides any needed tutorials for installation and usage both in the application and the products website. The program will need to be run on any computer with Windows 7 SP1 or higher installed on it, a safe bet will be to have it run on something made in the year 2015 or after.
  The free version of the product will be completely functional in what this project needs. If we, ColourTech, wanted more cloud options and technical support there is an option available given by Microsoft
  of an initial $1199 AUD first year payment and subsequent $799 product renewal for these and a few more added features.

  The hardware required in the project will be the use of Arduino technology for prototyping. These can be purchased from electronic shops like Jaycar or the Arduino product page (https://www.arduino.cc/). The usage of this hardware will not need any licences as the developers of Arduino promote open source development and usage. Arduino has its own IDE, currently ARDUINO 1.8.11 (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and uses a set of C/C++ functions which can be called to direct the hardware. Once the device is prototyped using Arduino, we will be able to submit the design to an electronics manufacturer for production.
  Familiarity with the components and the Arduino functions and other language specifics will take roughly a month. This can be made easier with the use of the multiple tutorials available on YouTube and Arduinos website making it very possible to become familiar and functional with Arduinos in a matter of a couple of weeks.

Project Plan
  Overview
    Topic
      The purpose of the computer acceleration safety device (CASD) is to aid the driver to stay within the speed limits of the roads they are traveling anywhere in the world and not be able to accelerate more than 10 km over the limit. It will also assist drivers buy when there are accidents and emergency vehicles in the area, major works or change of conditions the CASD device will notify the car that speed limit has changed due to these circumstances and change its speed accordingly.
      Potential outcomes for the population is a decrease in the number of deaths on our roads due to high-speed crashes which will mean decreased costs such as accident costs, decrease insurance costs, maintenance on roads and vehicle costs. Not to mention the reduced costs to society itself by services will no longer be stretch in relation to ambulance, police, hospital staff and clean up crews and maintenance crews the lists go on,  the government then can then use these services were there actually needed.

    Motivation
      So as IT  student we are told to find real-world problems and solve them so here's a little history on the problem we see, in 1901 when speed limits were introduced to Australia and was designed to increase safety on our roads and reduce crashes than the speed camera was introduced in 1961 with a radar device inside to catch people speeding(Davis, 2020) as you can see from table below in the last 24 months 2,431 people have being in crashes relating to speeding, and in 2019 there were 4.7% more deaths on Australia roads than the same period as 2018(Roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au, 2020). Our CASD  is going to save lives this should be motivation enough but the second is to reduce the number of crashes on our roads and third of all is that this project will make a difference in people's lives and that why we go into IT in the first place.

      Seroius injuries crash data - June 2019 quarter
                                      12 months ending  12 months ending
                                      Jun 2019p	        Jun 2018	       # Change	% Change
      Behavior Factors
      Alcohol involved in crash 'Yes'	335	              362	             -27	    -7%
      Speeding involved in crash 'Yes	1179	            1252	           -73	    -6%
      Fatigue involved in crash 'Yes'	629	              644	             -15	    -2%

      Why is this project important or interesting?
      Overall the CASD s will be controversial because it will change laws for car owners and their rights and responsibilities regarding driving their cars. This system will also reduce the resources needed by the government to regulate car safety to speed limits. I know firsthand from working in a hospital as an orderly than the devastation that high-speed crashes not only from the victims but the family them self’s not only physically but mentally.

       How does it fit in with current IT trends?
      Then the CASD system is on-trend as the increase of technology for cars is increasing with more airbags being introduced into vehicles for safety,  along with lane assist sensors that help guide the car back into the lane,  sensors in front of the car to ensure that your car doesn’t get to close to vehicle in front and will hit the brakes if it detects obstacles in its path even cruise control being the norm in cars today and this is all about driver and passenger safety and that’s what our device is designed for everyone safety.

      What would it show to a future employer if you were able to work on this project? At least one paragraph is expected.
      Over the course of the next couple of years, our team would like to have learned and gain the knowledge and experience to have least created and designed a working scale model of our device along with the skills and team behind us to make it become a  reality. This will demonstrate that our team has a vision and a passion for what we do. The employer will see this and so much more as teamwork is such a big part of the career path we have chosen and that we had a vision and no matter what our differences were we produced the CASD that works and has changed people lives and that what all IT professional want to do.

    Landscape
      There are speed limiters out there that reduce the car overall speed of the motor vehicle example of this are Australia trucks are limited to 100kms an hour, these are call governors there are different types our there such  Mechanical, Pneumatic and Hydraulic governors (The Engineers Post, 2020). Also, there Electronic Speed Governor which is micro-control base (I diagnosis.in, 2020) but these governors don’t take into consideration the variety of speed limits changes and does reduce the car overall speed to no more than 10kms over the speed limit.  Self-driver cars use radar, sensors, GPS, sonar and lidar to take in their surroundings to ensure they keep in the guidelines of the road rules (Jameco.com, 2020).
      Market in this field is companies such as Tesla, wymo, gm cruise, argo Ai, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, Continental Automotive Systems, Autoliv Inc., Bosch, Nissan, Toyota, Audi, Volvo, Vislab from University of Parma, Oxford University and Google. But what these companies all have in common that their concentration on driverless cars. Our system is for the everyday driver that doesn’t what a completely drives car. The CASD system will always still let the driver be in control of the vehicle up to ten km over the speed limit, the default setting wherein case the GPS and sensor go down for any reason the car can still can be driven. Added features of sensors that a read any vehicle such as an emergency one, witches hats, work road signs on the road to random changes of conditions where the sensors on these can be changed to reduce speeds in this area and our system will limit speed accordingly.

    Scope and limits
      What we like to achieve with the CASD system by the end of this project is that the system is practically by showing data that we can show that the CASD system can slow down the vehicle and even stop it. Number two is the features and functions that we aim to set out to are on point and achievable through the research that our colorTech team has set. Like all projects, the CASD system has certain elements of what we can achieve and their limits of what we can do with the project and this can be broken down into categories these are.
      •	Timeline -  of project is from what we can show in twelve weeks is limited to the research we have done and also what we can show data, it will take time to build the right team together with the knowledge to build and design a CASD system in an automobile.

      •	Budget – is a major issue with the project will have to show the concept works and fund this ourselves  then create and design a prospectus to show investors to raise capital to launch the product.

      •	Research
      1.	Patterns that we need around the world.
      2.	Laws into Automobiles with this system and how they be view when taking product work wide.
      3.	Manufacturing how we going to produce and supply our product to the world and the warehouse space and employees that we need.
      4.	Installation service  will provide or manufactures of cars will install, also after-hours service and warranty and claims

      •	Knowledge – Our colorTech team only has a limited know-how so to speak in regards to moving from a concept project idea to a full-scale working model of the CASD system.

      •	Planning  –  due to the actual scale of our project from concept to working model we have to ensure that we look at one piece of the puzzle at a time and ensure we have the right people in place.

      •	Obstacles – these are always going to be in our way but how we deal with them and the way we work as a team will ensure we find a way to work through to achieve our goals.

      •	Technology  -  we have to be careful by the time we build the CASD system that we haven’t missed the boat and that it’s too late and  there are newer  technologies out there that do the job better or that the manufacture produce the system them self’s.

    Group processes and communications
    Our group primarily uses Microsoft Teams for all communication which includes meetings that occur every Thursday and Sunday at 8pm AEDST, any small or large updates, issues etc. We also use discord as a backup in case MS Teams is down or a teammate is not responding. For any formal communication, generally the whole team and teacher are notified, is done via Microsoft Outlook email. There have been a few times where the team has been involved in an email to the teacher regarding a teammate not responding and regarding assignments where a teammate cannot participate fully due to personal reasons/safety concerns due to natural disasters. Sadly, we’ve had to conclude to remove a teammate from our due to lack of any communication despite numerous attempts to reach him via MS Teams, Discord and email with the whole team and Teacher included to give an ultimatum, respond or be removed from the team and be put down as 0% contribution.

Group processes 
While our group is largely introverted with vastly different personalities, the team worked very well together. We separated the assignment into individual tasks as equally as possible. While each of the task were done excellently and on time, there was an issue with the natural disaster occurring during the assignment which caused a small delay with a task being submitted that ultimately lost marks as we only had time to ask the questions that was in the assignment instead of being able to add our own to the mix. Overall, the team was very happy with the results as we were able to walk away with a High Distinction, even with the issues that occurred partway through. We will take this confidence in stride through to the next assignments to come.
